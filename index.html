      <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Shane and I'm a twenty nine year who is currently studying web development. I'm currently living in Vancouver and have been for the last three years. I'm original from a small village in the west of Ireland and have lived for most of my life until I made the move to San Francisco six years ago. Since then I have enjoyed travelling around the world and have no intensions of stopping anytime soon.</p> 
        <p>I decided to persue a career in web development because it's something I found very intersesting and challenging at the same time. I find great pleasure in problem solving and learning new things in a fast-paced enviroment.</p>
